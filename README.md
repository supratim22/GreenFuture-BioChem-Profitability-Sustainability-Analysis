# GreenFuture BioChem: Profitability & Sustainability Analysis

## Overview
This project evaluates the financial performance and environmental sustainability of GreenFuture BioChem.
The objective was to assess plant efficiency, profitability, and emissions tradeoffs across regions and
identify operational optimization opportunities.

## Data & Methodology
- Combined 8+ datasets covering production, revenue, and emissions
- Cleaned and standardized plant-level data using Python (Pandas)
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to compare margins and carbon intensity
- Modeled operational scenarios to evaluate efficiency improvements
- Built Tableau dashboards to communicate results visually

## Key Results
- Identified inefficiencies in the AM plant relative to peer facilities
- Demonstrated revenue growth potential exceeding **$16B** under expansion scenarios
- Highlighted tradeoffs between profitability and emissions across regions
- Delivered clear, decision-ready visual summaries via Tableau
